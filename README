HomeControl is a Home Control Suite that runs on a multitude of devices and interfaces with many others.

The main device is a Raspberry Pi, with an Arduino connected to expand the IO of the Pi.

The Pi will run a Java server program that will process all connections and commands from clients.
It will also run a client program showing various information on an attached screen.

XBMC will be interfaced using the JSON-RPC API, allowing control without having to modify your XBMC installation

Windows will be interfaced using a service that will read data and control the computer in the background, to keep intrusion to a minimum.
